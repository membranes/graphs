      "description": "Our organisation manually classifies trauma incidents for all the major trauma centres of five countries.  Per trauma case, an injury coding expert <b>(a)</b> examines the case's free and structured text, and assigns each piece of text to a category, and <b>(b)</b> assigns the case to a trauma category based on the combination text pieces & categories detected; text pieces of the other/miscellaneous category are excluded from this exercise.  Trauma injury coding is an extremely intensive and time-consuming exercise, and injury coding error rates - per annum - can be quite high.  Hence, and as a first step, we are in search of a solution that automatically classifies text pieces vis-Ã -vis a set of provided categories."
