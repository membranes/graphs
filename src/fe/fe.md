# Fuel & Energy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use the classification liquid fuels, it is ambiguous, e.g., it tends to include liquid biofuels, amongst others.

In addition to recording measures at the most granular level possible, a detailed fuel & energy table will ensure

* each fuel & energy depenendent event is recorded againast the correct fuel & energy classification
* the correct unit of measure is available
