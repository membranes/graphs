# Fuel & Energy

* Do not use the classification liquid fuels, it is ambiguous, e.g., it tends to include liquid biofuels, amongst others.

In addition to recording measures at the most granular level possible, a detailed fuel & energy table will ensure

* each fuel & energy dependent event is recorded against the correct fuel & energy classification
* the correct unit of measure is available 


## Options

### Electricity

* Grid Electricity
* On Site Renewable Electricity Generation

<br>

### District Heating

* District Heating

<br>

### Stationary Combustion

In contrast to the accounting table, this group includes the elements of `biofuel heating`.  Hence, the underlying energy sources are

* Natural Gas <fuel gas>
* Heavy Fuel Oil <fuel oil>
* Gas Oil <fuel oil>
* Burning Oil (i.e., Kerosene) <fuel oil>
* Liquefied Petroleum Gas (i.e., LPG) <fuel gas>
* Wood Pellets <[Biomass](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/)>
* Wood Chips <[Biomass](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/)>
