The listed bodies are grouped by division.  The divisions are 

* Ministers, The Parliament
* Holders of offices in the Scottish Administration which are non-ministerial offices
* Local Government
* National Health Service
* Educational Institutions
* Police
* Others

A division may have its own overarching classifications, e.g., Scotland's National Health Service organisations fall into one of the following health organisation classes

* Regional
* Special
* Public

A data model should reflect these.
