## The Listed Bodies

The listed bodies are grouped by division.  The divisions are 

* Ministers, The Parliament
* Holders of offices in the Scottish Administration which are non-ministerial offices
* Local Government
* National Health Service
* Educational Institutions
* Police
* Others

A division may have its own overarching classifications, e.g., Scotland's National Health Service organisations fall into one of the following health organisation classes

* Regional
* Special
* Public

A data model should reflect these.

## Data Model Outline

Conceptually, each instance of a list of bodies represents a distinct body.  In addition to the order's explicitly named bodies, ensure that the inventory of bodies includes

* Local Government Bodies: **(a)** [32 local authorities](https://www.mygov.scot/organisations#scottish-local-authority), **(b)** [7 regional transport partnerships](https://www.transport.gov.scot/our-approach/strategy/regional-transport-partnerships/)
* Educational Institutions
* Integration Joint Boards: REF. [9.2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/9/section/9) of  [Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/9/contents)
