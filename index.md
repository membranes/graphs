Climate & Sustainability: Emissions
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<br>

These pages propose a few *conceptual data models* for acquiring the data measures underlying the direct & indirect demands of Climate Order 2015.  It requires

* The continuous tracking, assessment, and trend analysis of greenhouse gas emissions; by emission source categories.
* The annual reporting of self-defined metrics.
* Forecasting & intelligent interventions; for emission, cost, waste, poor health, etc., minimisation purposes. 
* etc.

In general, if a pair of emission sources have disaccordant features, record their details via separate sets of fact & dimension tables.  It is straightforward to 

1. Extract a variety of aggregates from such data sets.
2. Continuously summarise a variety of metrics; in compliance with the self-defined metrics reporting request.
3. Conduct a variety of decision augmenting modelling & analysis; in aid of proactive emission, cost, waste, etc., minimisation expectations.

via well structured, highly granular, integrious, disaggregated raw measures.

There are separate sections for mileage and premises.  The fuel & energy section suggest a preliminary table structure whence an energy source might be selected for any purpose, e.g., a building, car, etc.



## Example

* emission source (black cab)
* emission group type (taxi)
* emission group (transport)


## Sources

* Premises: Due to electric power consumption (grid electricity, onsite renewable electricity), heating (natural gas, onsite renewable head etc.),
* Transport (all vehicle types),
* Medical Gas
* Refrigerant
* Transport
* Transmission & Distribution {Grid Electricity, District Heat & Steam, Renewable Heat, Renewable Electricity}
* Equipment
* Water
* Waste
