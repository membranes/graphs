Climate & Sustainability: Emissions
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<br>

These pages propose a few *conceptual data models* for acquiring the data measures required for the direct & indirect demands of Climate Order 2015

* The continuous tracking, assessment, and trend analysis of greenhouse gas emissions; by emission source categories.
* Forecasting & intelligent interventions; for emission, cost, waste, poor health, etc., minimisation purposes. 
* etc.

In general, if a paif of emission sources have disaccordant features, record their details via separate sets of fact & dimension tables.  It is straightforward to 

1. continuously summarise a variety of metrics, and [in compliance with metrics reporting requests]
2. conduct a variety of decision augmenting modelling & analysis, [in compliance with proactive & trackable  expectations]


via well structured, highly granular, integrious, disaggregated raw measures.
