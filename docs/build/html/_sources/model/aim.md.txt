[^constraints]: A few important constraints or considerations.  The model algorithm or architecture (a) must be designed for token classification, (b) feature contextual pattern learning, \(c\) offer the wherewithal to specify custom tags, (d) must be an open architecture/pre-trained model source designed by a reputable algorithm/architecture designer.  Additionally, in the case of pre-trained models, the training corpus must be open.
